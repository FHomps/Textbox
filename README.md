# Textbox
Fast generator/manager of SFML textures for textboxes (and other boxes too!). Uses a .png template to know what to put in the corners / sides / center of the box. Keeps generated textures in memory so as to not regenerate them if needed again.

## sfml-vscode-boilerplate
A cross-platform [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) 2.5.1 & C++17 build environment for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Fork from https://github.com/andrew-r-king/sfml-vscode-boilerplate adapted to my personal IDE preferences.
